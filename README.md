**Sales Performance**

Optimizing Sales Performance & Customer Retention Through Data-Driven Insights.

Sales teams often struggle with identifying key factors influencing deal success, understanding why deals are lost, and optimizing their sales pipeline efficiency. Additionally, predicting customer churn risk and 
uncovering seasonal sales trends is crucial for improving revenue and retention. This project aims to analyze sales performance, deal success patterns, and customer churn risks using SQL and Power BI to drive strategic 
decision-making.

**SQL Analysis:**

1. Predicting High-Value Deals Using Revenue Percentile Analysis 
- classifies deals into high, mid, and low-value segments and identifies which sales agents close the most high-value deals.
2. Sales Pipeline Velocity Analysis
- Identify which accounts are moving faster or slower through different deal stages and can highlight bottlenecks.
3. Average Deal Closing Time by Industry
- Calculate the average number of days taken to close a deal for each industry.
4. Churn Risk Analysis Based on Deal Loss Patterns
- This query identifies accounts with a high risk of churn by calculating the lost deal percentage and the time gap since their last won deal.
5. Sales Seasonality & Revenue Impact Analysis
- This query identifies seasonal trends in sales performance by analyzing revenue fluctuations across months and years.
