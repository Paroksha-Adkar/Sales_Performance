**Sales Performance**

Optimizing Sales Performance & Customer Retention Through Data-Driven Insights.

Sales teams often struggle with identifying key factors influencing deal success, understanding why deals are lost, and optimizing their sales pipeline efficiency. Additionally, predicting customer churn risk and 
uncovering seasonal sales trends is crucial for improving revenue and retention. This project aims to analyze sales performance, deal success patterns, and customer churn risks using SQL and Power BI to drive strategic decision-making.

Conducted comprehensive sales data analysis using SQL to uncover key business insights: 
1. Identified Retail as the highest-performing industry
2. Revealed a 28% deal attrition rate requiring strategic intervention
3. Forecasted revenue dips in January and April 2018 to support preemptive campaign planning.
4. Delivered data-driven recommendations including incentive models for high-performing agents, regional performance optimization for the underperforming East region, and corrective measures for the underperforming GTK product series.

**SQL Analysis:**

1. Identifies which sales agents are most effective at closing high-value deals to inform training and incentive strategies.
2. Tracks account progress through deal stages to detect bottlenecks and suggest process improvements.
3. Calculates average deal closing time segmented by industry to benchmark and optimize sales cycles.
4. Flags accounts at high risk of churn by analyzing lost deal percentages and inactivity since the last successful deal.
5. Reveals monthly and yearly revenue patterns to uncover seasonal impacts on sales performance.
